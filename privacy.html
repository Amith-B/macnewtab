      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="subtitle"><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 2025</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        macNewTab is a Chrome extension that provides a macOS-style new tab
        experience with widgets for clock, calendar, search, and quick links.
        This extension is designed purely for personal convenience and does not
        collect or store any personal information.
      </p>

      <h2>Google Sign-In</h2>
      <p>
        macNewTab uses <strong>Google Sign-In</strong> only to let users access
        their Google Calendar events securely within the extension. The sign-in
        process is handled entirely by Google’s own authentication interface.
        The extension never has access to your password or sensitive
        credentials.
      </p>

      <h2>Permissions</h2>
      <p>
        The extension requests only the minimum permissions required to function
        properly:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>identity</strong> — to allow optional Google Sign-In and
          identify the logged-in user for displaying their calendar events.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly</strong> —
          to read upcoming events from your Google Calendar (if enabled).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>storage</strong> — to locally store small preferences like
          layout mode, theme, or enabled widgets.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>chrome_url_overrides</strong> — to replace the default new tab
          page with the macOS-style interface.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All data accessed using these permissions stays entirely on your device.
        macNewTab does <strong>not</strong> send or share any information with
        external servers.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>
      <p>
        macNewTab does not collect, log, or transmit any personal data. Any data
        retrieved via Google APIs (such as calendar events) is displayed only
        within your local browser session and not stored or shared externally.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Protection Mechanisms for Sensitive Data</h2>
      <p>
        macNewTab ensures robust security for the Google user data it accesses
        (Calendar Events). Since the extension <b>does not transmit or store</b>
        this sensitive data on any external servers controlled by the developer,
        the following mechanisms are in place:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Secure Communication (TLS/HTTPS):</strong> All data fetched
          from and sent to Google APIs, including the authentication process
          (OAuth 2.0 via <code>chrome.identity</code>), is transmitted
          exclusively over <b>secure, encrypted channels</b> using Transport Layer
          Security (<b>TLS/HTTPS</b>). This prevents eavesdropping and tampering
          during data transfer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Client-Side Processing:</strong> Sensitive Calendar data is
          processed and rendered <b>entirely within the user's local browser
          environment</b>. It remains on the user's device and is secured by the
          operating system and browser's built-in sandboxing and security
          features.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>OAuth 2.0 Compliance:</strong> We adhere strictly to the
          <b>OAuth 2.0 protocol</b>, ensuring that we never handle or store the
          user's Google credentials (passwords). We only interact with Google's
          secure access tokens.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Minimization:</strong> The extension is limited to
          <b>read-only access</b> (<code>calendar.readonly</code>) to Google Calendar data,
          significantly reducing the security surface area.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Data Retention and Deletion Policy</h2>
      <p>
        As macNewTab only stores Google user data (calendar events) <b>locally
        and temporarily</b> within the user's browser, the retention and deletion
        processes are directly controlled by the user:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Retention:</strong> Google user data is retained <b>only
          for the duration of the browser session</b> or as a temporary cache in
          local browser storage to improve performance while the extension is
          installed. The data is <b>not retained on any external server</b>
          controlled by macNewTab.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Deletion by Uninstallation:</strong> The
          <b>uninstallation</b> of the macNewTab Chrome extension from the browser
          will automatically and permanently delete all locally stored Google
          user data and preferences from the user’s device.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Revocation of Access (Immediate Deletion):</strong> Users can
          immediately and permanently revoke macNewTab's access to their Google
          Account and all associated data by visiting the Google Account
          Security page:
          <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank"
            >https://myaccount.google.com/permissions</a
          >. <b>Revoking access immediately stops all data access and future
          processing.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Developer Contact for Deletion:</strong> For any specific
          concerns or to confirm that all data has been deleted, users can
          contact the developer via the methods listed in the 'Contact' section.
          Since we do not store external data, this confirmation relates only to
          the revocation of access.
        </li>
      </ul>
